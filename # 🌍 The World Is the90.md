# 🌍 The World Is the Scene

> _“The world is the scene set to tell your story.”_

Welcome to a Clojure project born from quiet rooms and luminous journeys.
Here, you're not just a developer—you’re a **clerk of clarity**, navigating
complexity with elegance.

## ✨ About This Project

This repository is a reflection of the Clojure experience:
- 🧠 Thoughtful design
- 🔁 Functional purity
- 🌌 A luminous path through the dark corners of computation

From your desk, you sense the **danger outside**—the bugs, the broken
builds, the brittle abstractions.
But here, in this space, we embrace the beauty of **immutable data**,
**composable functions**, and **REPL-driven development**.

## ⚠️ When Things Go Unwell

Programming in Clojure isn’t always smooth. You might encounter:
- ❌ Cryptic stack traces
- 🐛 Subtle bugs in lazy sequences
- 🔄 Misbehaving transducers
- 📉 Performance dips in unexpected places

This project documents those moments too—because every luminous journey
includes shadows.
