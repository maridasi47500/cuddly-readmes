🎭 EchoStage — Where Identity Performs

*“It’s not the real me. But it’s the version that shows up.”*

*EchoStage* is a creative framework for building expressive digital
profiles—whether real, fictional, or somewhere in between. Inspired by the
visual language of performing arts—makeup, music, dance, and
stagecraft—EchoStage lets anyone publish a person that’s decorated,
stylized, and powered by LLM-generated data.

These profiles aren’t performers. They’re *performed*—like characters on a
stage, dressed in data and design.
🌟 What Is EchoStage?

EchoStage isn’t about being a performing artist. It’s about *performing
identity*—through visuals, narrative, and illusion.

Your person can represent:

   -

   👩‍⚕️ A nurse with a neon-lit avatar and poetic status updates
   -

   🧑‍🏫 A teacher whose profile dances between fact and fiction
   -

   🧑‍🍳 A chef whose CSS glitters like a Michelin star
   -

   🧑‍💼 A corporate persona with theatrical flair
   -

   🧑‍🎨 A digital muse with surrealist makeup and animated moods

Any job. Any role. Any vibe. EchoStage turns your profile into a stage.
