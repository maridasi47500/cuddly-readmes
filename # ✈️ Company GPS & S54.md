# ✈️ Company GPS & Social Database Platform

A global, GPS-enabled company-networking platform connecting users to
workplaces through dynamic digital identities and media-rich relational
data.

## 📍 Core Concept

- Users are linked to **multiple plane tickets**, each representing:
  - Their country of origin
  - A connected phone number
  - Relational entries for different companies

- Each ticket functions as a **relational database menu**:
  - Details of company offerings
  - Communication channels
  - Media and services

## 📱 Digital Identity & Media Integration

- Users can link:
  - Social media accounts
  - Personal digital ID
  - Visual profiles (e.g., iPhone-style images or pictures of users
partying)

- These profiles help represent company culture and user engagement.

## 🌐 Purpose

To create an immersive, interactive ecosystem where:
- Physical location
- Digital identity
- Company communication
...are all seamlessly woven together via GPS-driven connections and
user-generated data.
