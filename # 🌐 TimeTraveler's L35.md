# 🌐 TimeTraveler's Logbook

Welcome to the chronicle of a traveler who sees cities not just as places,
but as moments. This repository captures snapshots of urban life—through
timestamps, textures, and tales—one photo at a time.

## 📸 Snapshot Ritual

Each city visit is marked by a photo—your time capsule.
Photos are analyzed for:
- **EXIF timestamps** – when was it really taken?
- **GPS metadata** – where exactly?
- **Subject clues** – what does it reveal about the city and about you?

## 🧳 How to Use This Repo

1. Clone the repo and explore the `cities/` folder.
2. Each subfolder = one city, with:
   - `photos/` – raw images
   - `journal.md` – travel notes
   - `metadata.json` – extracted time/location data
3. Use `extract_time.py` to pull timestamps from images.
4. Add your own entries and become a fellow time traveler.

## ✨ Philosophy

> “Cities are books you read with your feet.”
> — TimeTraveler's Manifesto

This project is a tribute to the idea that every city holds a story, and
every photo is a portal. Whether you're chasing sunsets in Santorini or
sipping chai in Delhi, the timestamp is your breadcrumb trail through time.
