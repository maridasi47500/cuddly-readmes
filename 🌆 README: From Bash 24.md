🌆 README: From Bash to the Boulevard

*"Using *sqlite3* in bash is like seeing only your database. But when day
breaks, you open your eyes to the city."*

This project is a meditation on duality:

   -

   *Night*: You collect timestamps, quietly logging every moment, every
   command, every heartbeat of your app.
   -

   *Day*: You walk through the city—your app lives in the real world,
   interacting with commerce, publications, and people. It speaks many
   languages, thanks to i18n.

🛠 What It Does

   -

   Logs bash activity into a SQLite database for personal analytics and
   auditing.
   -

   Captures timestamps with precision, turning your shell into a diary of
   intent.
   -

   Powers your app to engage with the world—whether it's publishing content
   or facilitating transactions.
   -

   Supports internationalization (i18n) so your app feels native wherever
   it's used.

🌍 Philosophy

This isn't just code. It's a way of seeing:

   -

   At night, you introspect. You log. You analyze.
   -

   At day, you connect. You publish. You trade.

Your app becomes a citizen of the world—just like you.
