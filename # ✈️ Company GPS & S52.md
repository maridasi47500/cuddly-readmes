# ✈️ Company GPS & Social Identity Platform

An interactive system that maps users to global companies via GPS, social
media, and digital identity—anchored through multi-functional "plane
tickets."

## 📍 Core Concept

- Each user is associated with **multiple plane tickets**, representing:
  - Their location and country of origin
  - A phone number
  - A communication channel with companies

- **Plane tickets act as interactive relational menus**:
  - Showcasing services and media from different companies
  - Capturing messaging and engagement history
  - Defining personalized database relationships

## 🖱️ Dynamic Interaction

- When a user **clicks a plane ticket**, it:
  - **Creates or activates** a custom database entry tied to that company
  - Launches direct interaction through messaging, media, or offers
  - Enables the user to engage in ongoing communication as part of the
system

## 📱 Digital Identity & Social Media

- Users can attach:
  - Social accounts
  - Digital IDs
  - Visual media (e.g., iPhone-style party snapshots)

- These assets enhance the ticket and strengthen their presence within the
company’s relational web.

## 🌐 Purpose

To create a richly layered, global network of users and companies—where
GPS, identity, media, and real-time interaction merge into a living
database.
