# 🧠 Self-Aware Language App

Welcome to the **Self-Aware Language App** — a bold experiment in
programming, creativity, and location-based expression. This app is built
around a custom language inspired by **Lisp** and **Clojure**, designed to
be **homoiconic** (or **paraiconic**) — meaning it can **know**, **edit**,
and **evolve** itself.

## 🚀 What It Does

- ✨ **Self-Editing Language**: The core of the app is a language that
treats code as data. You can introspect, modify, and extend the language
from within itself.
- 📍 **GPS-Linked Creativity**: Choose a location in the app using GPS.
Each place becomes a canvas for your code and ideas.
- 📞 **Phone-Number Identity**: Your phone number acts as your unique
identity, tying your contributions to a personal narrative.
- 📱 **App Creation Engine**: Use the language to build mini-apps, tools,
or expressions — all within the app itself.
- 📅 **Daily Word Growth**: Every day, you add new words to your language.
It grows with you, becoming more expressive and personal over time.

## 🧬 Philosophy

This isn't just a programming tool — it's a living, breathing language. It
reflects your thoughts, your places, your identity. It’s a
**meta-language**, a **creative diary**, and a **location-based code
ecosystem**.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Custom Lisp-like interpreter
- GPS integration
- Phone number-based user identity
- Dynamic word expansion engine
- Minimal UI for code editing and app creation

## 🌍 Use Cases

- Build location-specific mini-apps
- Create evolving code-based journals
- Explore language design and self-modifying systems
- Prototype ideas that grow organically over time

## 📦 Installation
