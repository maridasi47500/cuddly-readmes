How to Talk About Making Something Funnier

Instead of saying “not fun,” you could describe it as being:

   -

   “*given a comedic twist*”
   -

   “*reframed with levity*”
   -

   “*turned into a laughable moment*”
   -

   “*spiced up with humor*”
   -

   “*made unexpectedly funny*”
   -

   “*revived with a wink*”

Example:  *The presentation was pretty dry, so I **gave it a comedic
twist** and
it woke everyone up.*
😒➡️😎 Making Something Less Cool... Cooler

Instead of saying something was “less cool” and then improved, try:

   -

   “*amped it up*” — added style or excitement
   -

   “*gave it some edge*” — made it more interesting or bold
   -

   “*made it pop*” — visual or energetic enhancement
   -

   “*turned up the vibe*” — vibe = instant cool factor
   -

   “*added some shine*” — made it stylish or modern
