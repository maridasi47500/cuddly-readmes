# 🧠 iaia: From Reading to Prompting

## 🚀 The Shift

The old way:
Spend 1000 hours reading to understand a domain.

The new way:
Write a prompt that turns a large language model (LLM) into your expert,
strategist, or collaborator—instantly.

This project is about building **IA IAs**: intelligent agents that can
create other intelligent agents. You define the role, the tone, the
language, and the context. Whether it's for a country, a community, or a
cause, your AI becomes the voice, the brain, and the publisher.

## 🌍 Local First: Speak Your Language, Serve Your Country

Start with the language you speak.
Start with the country you live in.
Build an AI that understands your culture, your policies, your people.

Example:
```text
Role: Digital Policy Advisor for France
Language: French first, English optional
Mission: Analyze EU tech regulations, propose national strategies
Tone: Formal, data-driven, culturally aware
Output: Publish weekly briefs in French, share insights on social media

Your prompt becomes a living agent—thinking, writing, and publishing in
your voice.
🛠️ What’s Inside

   -

   roles/: Prompts that define expert personas (e.g., strategist,
   journalist, advisor)
   -

   meta/: Prompts for building IA IAs—agents that generate other agents
   -

   publish/: Templates for publishing messages (web, social, newsletter)
   -

   media/: Instructions for serving images, videos, or files via your
   website

📡 Publishing Options

Even if all you know is how to:

   -

   🖼️ Serve a picture on your website
   -

   🎥 Embed a video
   -

   📁 Link to a file
   -

   🌐 Or just make a website work

That’s enough. Because the AI can do more than you. It can write,
translate, simulate, strategize, and publish. You just need to give it a
role—and a place to speak.
🕰️ Context-Aware Intelligence

In the app, you should tell:

   -

   What time you're living in
   -

   What country you're living in

And the app should tell you:

   -

   What people you may be tied to
   -

   What roles you could play
   -

   What messages you could publish
   -

   What events you could plan

Just like a voice assistant, your AI should help you:

   -

   🗓️ Plan your day
   -

   📌 Set events
   -

   🧭 Navigate your world

But instead of just reacting, it *creates*—agents, strategies, and stories.
💡 Why This Matters

   -

   *Speed*: Skip the 1000h of reading. Learn by building.
   -

   *Precision*: Define exactly how your AI should behave and communicate.
   -

   *Scalability*: Create agents that build agents—your own AI ecosystem.
   -

   *Localization*: Start with your language, your country, your context.
   -

   *Expression*: Publish your AI’s message in any format you can serve.
   -

   *Expansion*: The AI can do more than you—so let it.

📚 Inspiration

This project is inspired by the shift from passive learning to active
creation. Instead of reading for 1000 hours, you now *design intelligence*—and
let it speak for you.
