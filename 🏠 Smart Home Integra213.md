🏠 Smart Home Integration: EchoStage + Home Assistant

With Home Assistant, your EchoStage person can trigger real-world routines
that match its digital mood or performance prompt.
Prompt Type Description
🎭 Theatrical Prompt Activate lighting scenes, music, and ambient effects
based on the persona’s dramatic flair
🪩 Party Prompt Trigger party lights, playlist, and smart display visuals
when the profile enters celebration mode
🎨 Visual Theme Sync smart bulbs and decor to match the CSS “makeup” of the
profile
🎼 Emotional Cue Play music or ambient sounds that reflect the tone of the
current LLM prompt

Instead of assigning static roles, EchoStage lets you write prompts like:


"A flamboyant digital florist who speaks in rhymed couplets and loves disco
lighting."

"A minimalist architect with a quiet tone and ambient jazz soundtrack."

"A surrealist poet who changes color schemes based on the moon phase."
These prompts become the script. The home responds like a backstage crew.
