☕️ Quando Vuoi (Whenever You Want)

🕒 *Always Open, Always Yours*

A living repository of poetic technology — where weather becomes a
companion, emojis tell your story, and AI helps you express the
inexpressible.
🌟 Concept

*Quando Vuoi* is more than an app — it's a philosophy of everyday life.
It’s H24 self-service coffee: comfort, creativity, and autonomy. It’s yo-yo
living: playful, rhythmic, and light-hearted. It’s a poetic interface for
navigating your world.
🌤️ Weather & City as Companions

   -

   The weather and the city aren’t just data — they’re characters in your
   daily narrative.
   -

   Your transportation lives in your bag: scarves, layers, and readiness.
   -

   Sometimes, the metaphors fade — and you realize you weren’t just talking
   to a “cloud” or a “sun.”

🚗 Messages & Emojis Based on Your Journey

   -

   Fuel your car → receive messages with weather icons.
   -

   Attend events → unlock emojis that reflect your emotional landscape.
   -

   Your life becomes a visual diary — spontaneous, symbolic, and alive.

🌍 Freedom of Movement & Choice

   -

   Choose your language, country, city, or season — the world adapts to you.
   -

   Enjoy a free phone plan — communication without borders.
   -

   Mobility is yours — transportation becomes a personal rhythm.

🎨 Creative Expression with AI

   -

   Write inside colored shapes — triangles, rectangles, and more.
   -

   Use AI to translate your thoughts or convert speech to text.
   -

   Express emotion through visual language — bridging imagination and
   technology.

🧭 Your Living Repository

This isn’t just a GitHub repo. It’s a poetic interface for living. Every
day is a story. Every tool is a companion. Every choice is yours.
🗣️ Vocal Assistants & Discovery

   -

   Ask Google to count to 10, check the weather, or talk to a “sun” or
   “cloud.”
   -

   Visit a gas station, a car rental, or a radio — and hear “anytime” like
   a loyalty card whispering back.
   -

   The line between metaphor and reality blurs — and that’s the beauty of
   it.
