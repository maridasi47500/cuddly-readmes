🌍 i18n-traveler-driver

*i18n-traveler-driver* is a conceptual and functional framework that
combines internationalization (i18n) with the metaphor of a traveler
navigating diverse environments. It enables dynamic interpretation,
direction handling, and code execution based on contextual cues—ideal for
applications that need to adapt across languages, regions, or unpredictable
runtime conditions.
✨ Overview

This project introduces a *driver-traveler* abstraction:

   -

   A *driver* who can move through various contexts, like navigating roads.
   -

   A *traveler* who can follow any direction, akin to holding a train or
   plane ticket—ready to explore any path.

🧭 Features

   -

   *Directional Awareness* Inspired by wooden road signs and indicators,
   the system interprets symbolic or literal directions to guide behavior.
   -

   *Contextual Interpretation* Recognizes keywords (e.g., "ruby") in
   real-world or runtime scenarios and can:
   -

      Print the detected string.
      -

      Execute corresponding code based on the situation.
      -

   *Dynamic Execution* Capable of running code in unpredictable or loosely
   defined traveler-like contexts, adapting to new environments on the fly.

🖼️ Visual Metaphor

The project draws on imagery such as:

   -

   Wooden signposts and directional panels.
   -

   Pointers and indicators as metaphors for routing and decision-making.
   -

   A traveler choosing paths based on available signs and tickets.

🔧 Use Cases

   -

   Internationalized applications needing flexible routing or behavior.
   -

   Systems that respond to runtime cues or user input in multiple languages.
   -

   Educational or experimental tools for exploring metaphor-driven
   programming.
