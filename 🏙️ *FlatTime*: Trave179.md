🏙️ *FlatTime*: Travel Without Leaving

*Live in a flat. Watch wildlife. Eat simply. Listen to radio.* Feel like
you're traveling in time — and across cities — without ever packing a bag.
🌆 What Is FlatTime?

FlatTime is a meditative urban simulator. You stay in your apartment, but
the world comes to you. Each day, you experience a different city, a
different era, a different mood — through curated wildlife videos, simple
meals, and radio music.

It’s not escapism. It’s slow travel. It’s not simulation. It’s sensation.

🛋️ Why FlatTime?

Because sometimes the best way to travel… is to stay still. To let the
world come to you. To eat simply, listen deeply, and watch quietly.
