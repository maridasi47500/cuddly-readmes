🚂 A *Rails app* is a web application built using *Ruby on Rails*, a
powerful framework that follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern.
It’s designed to help developers build full-stack web apps quickly and
efficiently.

Here’s a quick breakdown of what a Rails app typically includes:
🧱 Core Components

   -

   *Model*: Manages data and business logic (e.g., User, Product)
   -

   *View*: Handles what users see (HTML templates with embedded Ruby)
   -

   *Controller*: Connects models and views, processes user input

⚙️ Features Rails Gives You Out of the Box

   Database integration with Active Record
   -

   Routing system to handle URLs
   -

   Built-in security protections
   -

   Background jobs and email handling
   -

🚀 Getting Started

To create a new Rails app, you’d typically run:
