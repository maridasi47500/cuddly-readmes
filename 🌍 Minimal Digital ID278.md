🌍 Minimal Digital ID — Your Passport to Experience

This concept turns your digital identity into a gateway for immersive
adventures and self-reflection:
🧭 Explore the World

   -

   Each digital “ticket” unlocks visits to countries, cities, and tourist
   attractions.
   -

   Visit museums as a virtual time traveler, experiencing history through
   digital immersion.
   -

   Use train-style access to reach regional attractions and post your
   journey on social media.

🌤 Live the Day Based on Weather

   -

   Plan outdoor activities for your free day depending on the local
   weather—flexible, spontaneous, free-spirited.

🔍 Reflect Through Repositories & Social Media

   -

   Compare your digital footprint (social media or code repositories) to
   others’.
   -

   Identify what’s kind vs. what’s harsh or critical.
   -

   Use a “Rails table” to summarize and visualize different friends' social
   media personalities.

🤝 Connect Through Shared Passions

   Engage in sports, video chats, or music with others using electronic
   instruments.
