🪞 Room-Based AI Inventory & Workflow

If you’ve got a *room*, then naturally, you’ve got:

   -

   A *comb*
   -

   A *mirror*
   -

   A *toothbrush*

These items represent the baseline of personal setup—tied directly to the
user.

And if you’ve got a *job*, then you’re working with:

   -

   Bullet points to break down tasks
   -

   AI logic structured in bullet-driven formats
