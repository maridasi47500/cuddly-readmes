🖼️ canvas-ai: Minimal Canvas for Digital Presence & Creative Reflection

   -

   *Elements*: Use basic visual shapes—circle, square, and text—to craft
   your expression.
   -

   *Beyond the Canvas*: Art exists in forms beyond the canvas; artists
   design identity through many mediums.
   -

   *AI & Language*: Language itself becomes a creative space when paired
   with AI—it’s not just what you say, but how you shape it.
   -

   *Cultural Echoes*: From statues at bus stops to live festivals, popular
   elements vary with place and time.
   -

   *Personal Rhythms*: When no public spectacle draws you in, your own
   quiet life becomes the focus.
