This project explores *visual and interactive experiences* that mimic or
critique social media environments, blending *design choices*, *data
authenticity*, and *AI augmentation*.
🎨 Visual Design Options

   -

   Choose between *circles or rectangles* for content layout
   -

   Use *colored backgrounds* or keep it minimal
   -

   Create interfaces that either:
   -

      Resemble *social media platforms*
      -

      Or deliberately *deviate* from them

🗃️ Data & Authenticity

   -

   Integrate with a *social media-style database*
   -

   Explore scenarios where:
   -

      The database is *filled with fake data*
      -

      Or *genuinely populated* with real user input
      -

   Optionally *augment* the experience with *AI*

🕹️ Activity Simulation

   -

   Select any *sport or activity* to simulate
   -

   Experience it as if:
   -

      You're *time-traveling* through a panoramic game world
      -

      You *know the rules deeply* or are just exploring
      -

      You're doing it *for the social media aesthetic*
      -

   Again, choose whether to *enhance* with *AI or not*

It sounds like a creative playground for experimenting with *interface
design*, *data realism*, and *immersive simulations*.
